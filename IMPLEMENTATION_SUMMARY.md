#### New Components
1. **LibraryItem Component** (`src/components/LibraryItem.tsx`)
   - Display categorized model lists
   - Two sections:
     - Sample Library: Default Gaussian models
     - User Library: User-uploaded models (placeholder)
   - File filtering (.splat, .ply)
   - Selection highlighting
   - Refresh button with loading state
   - Error handling
   - Hugging Face dataset integration

#### Context/Services
1. **HuggingFaceDatasetManager** (`src/context/HuggingFaceDatasetManager.ts`)
   - Class for managing Hugging Face dataset interactions
   - Methods:
     - `listAllFiles()`: List all files recursively
     - `ListFolderFile(folderName)`: List files in specific folder
     - `uploadFile(filePath, fileContent)`: Upload file to dataset
   - Configuration: Uses repo "XuanHuy224/GaussianSample"
   - API key from environment variable

#### Routing Implementation
1. **React Router Setup**
   - Installed `react-router-dom` package
   - Wrapped App with `BrowserRouter` in `main.tsx`
   - Created Routes in `App.tsx`:
     - `/` - Home page
     - `/library` - Library page
     - `/reconstruction` - Reconstruction page

2. **Navigation Enhancement**
   - Updated `NavBar.tsx` with navigation links
   - Active route highlighting
   - Three main navigation buttons:
     - Home (blue theme)
     - Library (green theme)
     - Reconstruction (purple theme)
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects

#### Environment Configuration
1. **`.env` file**
   - Added `VITE_HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY` for dataset access
   - API key: (set locally in your `.env` file, do NOT commit secrets. Example placeholder: `VITE_HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY=hf_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)
   - NOTE: The real token was removed from history to comply with push protection. Revoke any previously exposed token in your Hugging Face account settings.

### 📦 Dependencies Installed
1. `@huggingface/hub` - Hugging Face dataset management
2. `react-router-dom` - Client-side routing

## 🌐 Application Routes
- **Home** (`/`) - Main landing page with default 3D viewer
- **Library** (`/library`) - Browse and view model library from Hugging Face
- **Reconstruction** (`/reconstruction`) - Upload images for 3D reconstruction

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### React Patterns Used
- **Functional Components** with TypeScript
- **Hooks**: useState, useEffect, useRef, useLocation
- **Component Composition** for reusability
- **Props Interface** for type safety

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS 4.0** utility-first styling
- **Gradient backgrounds** for modern look
- **Glassmorphism** effects with backdrop blur
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **Smooth animations** and transitions
- **Active state highlighting** for navigation

### State Management
- **Local state** with useState for component-specific data
- **Context/Service pattern** for Hugging Face integration
- **File upload state** management in Reconstruction page
- **Model selection state** in Library page

### API Integration
- **Hugging Face Hub** for dataset management
- **Environment variables** for API keys
- **Async/await** for API calls
- **Error handling** with try-catch blocks
- **Loading states** for better UX

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd vr-travel-redux
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Already configured in `.env` file
   - API key for Hugging Face dataset access

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/`
   - Try different pages:
     - Home: View default 3D model
     - Library: Browse model collection
     - Reconstruction: Upload images

## 📋 Next Steps (Optional)

### Future Enhancements

   - User login/signup
   - User-specific library
   - Protected routes

2. **API Integration**
   - Complete reconstruction API endpoint
   - Real 3D reconstruction processing
   - Progress tracking for reconstruction

3. **Library Features**
   - Search and filter models
   - Model details and metadata
   - Download models
   - Share functionality

4. **Reconstruction Improvements**
   - Image preview before upload
   - Batch processing
   - Reconstruction history
   - Quality settings

5. **Performance**
   - Lazy loading for model list
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Progressive Web App (PWA)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
- **Modern & Clean**: Minimalist design with focus on content
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive navigation and clear CTAs
- **Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all screen sizes
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and smooth interactions
- **Accessible**: Proper contrast and interactive elements

## 📝 Notes
- TypeScript errors may show temporarily due to cache - refresh VS Code
- Port 3000 is in use, using port 3001 instead
- Hugging Face dataset: `XuanHuy224/GaussianSample`
- Default model: Bonsai 7k mini from dylanebert/3dgs
